# NN-city-scraper
Scrape accessors site for Storm Water data on the city. 
Note WIP - the casper script gets rate limited so we're not able to get the full parcelID matching to scrape. 
we can bypass it by not requiring the address/parcel_id decoding if we had the list


Requires
===
- Python 3.5+ 
- [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/)
- Postgres
